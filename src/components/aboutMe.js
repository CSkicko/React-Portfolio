            <p>Hi! My name is Craig Skicko and I have been working as an Engineering Consultant for over 7 years, delivering a variety of projects across the UK and Australia.</p>
            <p>I have always had an interest in solving analytical problems, and from a young age showed talent as a programmer.</p>
            <p>Recently, I discovered a passion for full stack web development and set out to build some simple applications using a variety of languages, tools and frameworks, including HTML, CSS, Javascript, Postgres and Django</p>
            <p>To further hone my skills, I have completed the Trilogy Web Development Bootcamp, run by Monash University. Here I have progressed my understanding of web development and broadened my knowledge of programming languages, computer science and industry best practices</p>
            <p>Moving forward, I would welcome discussions surrounding opportunities to further utilise my skillset and deliver full stack applications to industry clients.</p>
